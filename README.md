RecipientListManagement
=======================

RecipientListManagement is a Sitecore ECM add-on that currently allows two things:

1.	Manage recipient lists: add new lists, import users, delete users from list etc.
2.	Limit user rights. Users only see the lists and messages that they have created/sent. Admins see everything.

Please read the Readme.docx and Warning.docx in /Documentation folder.
